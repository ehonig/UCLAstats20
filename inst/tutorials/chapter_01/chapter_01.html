<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div id="section-what-is-statistical-programming" class="section level3">
<h3>What is Statistical Programming?</h3>
<p><strong>Computer programming</strong> involves writing instructions (<strong>code</strong>) to control a computer: what to calculate, what to display, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical computing</strong> involves creating and/or using software to do computations to aid in statistical analysis:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Data is summarized and displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistical models are fit to the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Results are displayed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Statistical programming</strong> involves writing code to aid in statistical analysis (i.e., the ``creating’’ part of statistical computing).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-why-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Why R?</h3>
<div id="section-what-is-r" class="section level4">
<h4>What is R?</h4>
<p>There are many applications that can be used for statistical computing: Excel, Fathom, Python, R, SAS, SPSS, Stata, etc.</p>
<p>We are interested in providing a foundation for understanding how statistical applications work. To do this, we will use R.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong> is a statistical software package and programming language.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R is widely used by statisticians all over the world.</p></li>
<li><p>It is open source and free to download.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can see how it is written and improve it.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can contribute their own code to expand its functionality.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-interfaces" class="section level4">
<h4>Interfaces</h4>
<p>Some applications (e.g., Fathom and SPSS) have a <strong>menu-based interface</strong>. Menu-based applications are easy to learn and use. However, they are also inflexible, as there is a limited set of commands from which to choose.</p>
<p>Some applications (including R) have a <strong>command-line interface</strong> that requires the user to type commands for the computer to run. These are open ended applications in which you can write your own customized programs. These are harder to learn, since they require more programming knowledge. But by taking the time to learn, command-line applications allow for a more fundamental understanding of programming, and the skills you learn will be transferrable to other programming languages you may learn in the future.</p>
</div>

<div id="section-preliminaries" class="section level2">
<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<div id="section-installing-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing R</h3>
<p>To install R, go to . Download and install the binaries for the base distribution for your operating system.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: All CLICC laptops have R preinstalled.</p>
<p>When you first open R, the <strong>R console</strong> will appear. The <code>&gt;</code> symbol in the corner indicates the <strong>command prompt</strong>, where R commands are entered and processed by the computer.</p>

<p>To make sure R has been properly installed, enter the basic command “<code>2 + 3</code>” (without quotation marks) into the command prompt. Press <code>Enter</code> to submit (<strong>run</strong>) the command.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="addition" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="addition-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>2 + 3</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>[1]</code> in front of the output <code>5</code> is an <strong>index</strong> to tell us that the first entry (or element) of the output is the number 5. This will be important later, when we have output vectors with more than one entry.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-incomplete-commands" class="section level3">
<h3>Incomplete Commands</h3>
<p>After our previous command, notice that the R console now shows a new command prompt below the output. This means R is ready for another command.</p>
<p>What happens if you enter the incomplete command “<code>2 +</code>” into the command prompt?</p>
<p>The bottom left corner will show a <code>+</code> symbol, indicating that the command from the previous line is not complete. For R to be able to run, you need to complete the command.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you make a mistake and do not want to complete the command, press the Escape (<code>Esc</code>) key to skip the incomplete line and start a fresh command prompt.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-commenting" class="section level3">
<h3>Commenting</h3>
<p>The # sign creates a comment so that the text is not read as an R command. It can be added at the beginning of the line or at the end of a command.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="comment" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is <em>absolutely necessary</em> to add comments to your code. Not only do comments help other readers to understand your code, but it also makes sure that you can remember what your code is doing. Well documented programs will often have more comments than actual lines of code.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
</div>
<div id="section-r-scripts" class="section level3">
<h3>R Scripts</h3>
<p>In most cases, typing directly into the R console is not ideal. For long and/or complicated programs, it is much more convenient to type the code in a separate text editor. This allows you to save the code you write and run multiple lines of code at once.</p>
<p>An <strong>R script</strong> (or <strong>script file</strong>) is a text file containing a set of R commands (i.e., a program). Within R, there is a basic built-in text editor that reads and writes R scripts. Any line of text written in the script file can be read into the console by pressing <code>Ctrl + R</code> on Windows or <code>Command + Enter</code> on Mac. Multiple lines can be run by first highlighting the lines you want to run.</p>
<p>You can save these text/script files as .R files. Using this filename extension, opening the script file will open in R.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing RStudio</h3>
<p>To make coding in R a little easier, we will also use <strong>RStudio</strong>, which is an <strong>integrated development environment (IDE)</strong> designed to help users program in R. It allows you to more easily edit your programs, keep track of the objects in your workspace, search for help, and fix errors.</p>
<p>To install RStudio, go to . Download and install the “Open Source License” version of “RStudio Desktop” for your operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: All computers in the computer lab and CLICC laptops have RStudio preinstalled.</p>
<p>A sample RStudio display is shown in Figure . Notice that there are four panes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bottom left: The R console</p></li>
<li><p>Top left: The R script file</p></li>
<li><p>Top right: Environment/History (more on this later), currently showing the <code>magnitudes</code> object in the global environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Bottom right: Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer, currently showing the histogram output from the last R command inputted into the console.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="section-r-markdown" class="section level3">
<h3>R Markdown</h3>
<p><strong>R Markdown</strong> is a useful and fairly simple way to generate documents that include R code and output. R Markdown files are text files that have a .Rmd extension. With a little bit of formatting syntax, R Markdown combines plain text and sections (or <strong>chunks</strong>) of R code that RStudio is able to compile (or <em>knit</em>) into a well formatted document for assignments, reports, and presentations. This set of notes was made using R Markdown.</p>
<p>An R Markdown document is dynamic and reproducible. The .Rmd file can be recompiled if the embedded R code or data changes, and the R output in the document will be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>We can create new R Markdown files in RStudio.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using the menu bar, choose “File – New File – R Markdown”.</p></li>
<li><p>A popup should appear. Input the title and author of the document.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose what output format the document will be in (HTML, PDF, or Word). The default is HTML.</p></li>
<li><p>After clicking “OK”, an R Markdown template file will be created.</p></li>
<li><p>To knit the file into an HTML document, click on the “Knit” button and choose “Knit to HTML”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To knit to a PDF file,  needs to be installed on your computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-working-directories" class="section level3">
<h3>Working Directories</h3>
<p>A <strong>working directory</strong> is the default folder (or directory) from which R reads and writes data.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="directory" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>getwd() # Returns the current working directory
setwd(&quot;~/Desktop&quot;) # Changes working directory to desktop</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":["function (label, user_code, solution_code, check_code, envir_result, ","    evaluate_result, envir_prep, ...) ","{","    tryCatch({","        user_code <- clean_input(user_code)","        solution_code <- clean_input(solution_code)","        uc <- styler::style_text(user_code)","        user_code <- paste(uc[uc != \"\"], collapse = \"\\n\")","        solution_code <- paste(styler::style_text(solution_code), ","            collapse = \"\\n\")","        if (user_code == solution_code) {","            list(message = learnr::random_praise(), correct = TRUE, ","                location = \"append\")","        }","        else {","            list(message = learnr::random_encouragement(), correct = FALSE, ","                location = \"append\")","        }","    }, error = function(e) {","        print(e)","    })","}"]}</script>
</div>
<p>You can also get/set the working directory from the menu bar in R or RStudio.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Since different data sets may use the same variable names, it is helpful to use a different working directory for each project or assignment.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-quitting-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Quitting R</h3>
<p>To quit an R session, run the quit function <strong><code>q()</code></strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q()</code></pre>
<p>Upon quitting, a popup will ask if you want to save an image of the current workspace. The workspace image will save a record of the computations and the saved results from the session in the working directory (the record of the computations are saved in a file called .Rhistory and the results are saved in a file called .RData).</p>
<p>Rather than saving the workspace, it is usually preferrable to save the R commands (in an R script) and reproduce the results later. For extensive programs that are difficult to reproduce quickly, manually saving objects in the workspace before quitting R gives more control over what you are saving (more on this later).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-calculator-computations" class="section level2">
<h2>Calculator Computations</h2>
<div id="section-basic-arithmetic" class="section level3">
<h3>Basic Arithmetic</h3>
<p>By typing arithmetic expressions into the command prompt, R is able to do basic calculator computations. Some examples:</p>

<div id="section-modular-arithmetic" class="section level3">
<h3>Modular Arithmetic</h3>
R is also able to do modular arithmetic using the <code>\%\%</code> and <code>\%/\%</code> operators. The <code>\%\%</code> operator computes the remainder after division. For example, the remainder after division of 46 by 7, i.e., 46 (mod 7), is written as:
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="mod" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

<p>The integer part of a fraction uses the <code>\%/\%</code> operator. If we want to know how many times 46 goes into 7, we can write:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="int" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

<p>The way the line is written, it is not clear which operation R will compute first: <code>2 + 3</code> or <code>3 * 3</code>.</p>
<p>Computing <code>2 + 3</code> would be true if R reads commands sequentially from left to right, the way that most simple calculators do. Fortunately, R is not a simple calculator. R follows the standard <strong>order of operations</strong> from basic arithmetic: PEMDAS (or BEDMAS).</p>

<h2>Objects and Functions</h2>
<p>John Chambers (co-inventor of S, the precursor to R):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Everything that exists is an object.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything that happens is a function call.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>R is what is known as an <strong>object-oriented language</strong>: Everything in R is stored as an object, and programs are written around manipulating objects. Formally, an <strong>object</strong> is a storage space (or data structure) with an associated name.</p>
<p>All objects created and stored in an R session are collectively called the <strong>workspace</strong>, also known the <strong>global environment</strong>.</p>
<div id="section-object-assignment" class="section level3">
<h3>Object Assignment</h3>
<p>To save objects/functions/anything into R’s current workspace, use the <strong>assignment</strong> operator <code>&lt;-</code>. Names of objects/functions/anything can contain letters, numbers, periods, or underscores and must start with a letter.</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: R is case-sensitive. <code>object</code>, <code>OBJECT</code>, and <code>ObJeCt</code> are all treated as different names.</p>
<p>The name of the object you want to make goes on the left of the <code>&lt;-</code>. The <code>&lt;-</code> is meant to resemble an arrow pointing to the left, to signify that you are assigning the output of the code on the right to the object name on the left.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The single equal sign <code>=</code> can also be used for assignment, but it is recommended to use the arrow <code>&lt;-</code>, since the direction of the assignment is clearer.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Andy Dwyer is interested in opening a savings account at Pawnee National Bank. Suppose the bank has a savings account that offers a 0.25% interest rate per year, compounded annually. What is the overall interest rate after 20 years? If Andy Dwyer put in an initial balance of $5000, what will the final balance be?</p>
<p>The interest rate over 20 years is <span class="math inline">\((1 + 0.0025)^{20} = 1.0025^{20}\)</span>. We can save this value in our workspace to use later.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<p><strong>Functions</strong> are a special type of object in R. They have a similar use and purpose as functions in mathematics. In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs such that each input is related to a single output. A function in R takes in certain input objects called <strong>arguments</strong> and returns an output by executing a set of commands.</p>
<div id="section-function-syntax" class="section level4">
<h4>Function Syntax</h4>
<p>The basic syntax to use (or <strong>call</strong>) a function is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>functionname(argument(s))</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A function has a name, parentheses, and arguments. Some arguments are required, some are optional, and some have built-in or <strong>default</strong> values. Multiple arguments are separated by commas.</p>
<p>There are many built-in functions already in R. For example, consider the quit function <code>q()</code>:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="quit_func" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

</div>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Calling <code>q()</code> from within the notes will cause the notes to, well, quit, and then crash. You <em>can</em> do it, but you may lose your progress and have to start over.</p>
<p>By typing the name of the quit function without parentheses, R shows us how the function is defined. There are three arguments: <code>save</code>, <code>status</code>, and <code>runLast</code>. Each argument has a default value specified by a single equal sign <code>=</code>: <code>"default"</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>FALSE</code>, respectively. We typically call <code>q()</code> with empty parentheses so that the arguments are left with their default values.</p>
<p>R function arguments can be matched positionally or by name. If we know the order of the arguments, we do not need to use the name in order to specify the arguments. However, it is typically better to use named arguments for clarity.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q(&quot;no&quot;) # Sets the save argument to &quot;no&quot;
q(save = &quot;no&quot;) # Same thing (but clearer)

q(, , FALSE) # Sets the runLast argument to FALSE
q(runLast = FALSE) # Same thing (but clearer)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that blank arguments do not erase the default values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q(FALSE) # This gives an error. Why?</code></pre>
<pre><code>Error in q(FALSE): one of &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;ask&quot; or &quot;default&quot; expected.</code></pre>
<p>The first argument of <code>q()</code> is the <code>save</code> argument, which expects an input of either <code>"yes"</code>, <code>"no"</code>, or <code>"default"</code>. If a different input is given (such as the value <code>FALSE</code>), R will throw an error.</p>

<h4>Creating Functions</h4>
<p>Any user can create new functions that build on top of the base R objects and functions. By creating our own functions, we can extend the functionality of R in practically unlimited ways.</p>
<p>Since functions are considered objects in R, we can still assign a name to the function and save it to the workspace using the assignment <code>&lt;-</code> operator.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>The definition of a function typically has the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The word <code>function</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A pair of round parentheses <code>()</code> containing the argument list (it may be empty).</p></li>
<li><p>A pair of curly braces <code>\{\}</code> containing a statement or sequence of statements (called the <strong>body</strong> of the function).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The basic syntax to create your own function is</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function_name &lt;- function(arguments) {
  # The body of the function goes here.
}</code></pre>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Indenting the body of the function is highly recommended, as it helps make the code more readable.</p></li>
<li><p>The output of the last command in the body will be the output of the function.</p></li>
<li><p>The body of the function creates a <strong>local environment</strong>, so objects created inside the function are accessible only within the function. The objects created locally will not appear in the global environment (your workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>Any objects in the global environment are still accessible within the function’s local environment. The global environment is thus also called the <strong>parent environment</strong> in relation to the local environment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Objects in the local environment will take precedence over objects in the global environment. In particular, if you use the same name for something within the body of a function as an object in the global environment, the global object will be <strong>masked</strong> by the local object: The object name within the function will reference the local object instead of the global one.</p>
<p>We will go into more detail about functions in a later chapter.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
